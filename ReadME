The "hash_gen.cpp" file is used to generate hash values from plain text and store the data into hash_value.dat file. This is simluating that the database and OS in real world store user passwords. 

Compile "hash_gen.cpp" file by using command "g++ -o hash_gen hash_gen.cpp". If you want to generate hashs for different plain text, please modify the "hash_gen.cpp" directly.

The "cracker.cpp" file is used to dictionary attack. We use "clock()" function to time the program. Compile the code using command "g++ -o cracker cracker.cpp"

Using command "./cracker $dictionary_path $hash_value.dat_path" to crack the password hash that saved inside the .dat file. 

=================================================================
Update 3/17/2016
Add parallelized programe (openMP version) to github.

Use command "g++ -fopenmp -o crackeromp cracker_omp.cpp " to compile "cracker_omp.cpp" file and submit bash "crackeromp.bash" to discovery cluster to run.

output file can be found in output folder.

=================================================================
Update 3/28/2016
Clean up folder. You can find sequential code in "seq_code" folder and Parallelized code in "par_code" folder.

Fix errors in SHA256.h file and regenerate correct hash list.

==================================================================
Update 3/29/2016
Added cracker.cu file. You can find it in "par_code/" folder.
To compile and run the program, please follow the below steps:
1. "nvcc -G -g -lineinfo -o crackercu cracker.cu" --- compile the .cu file
2. "./crackercu $dictionary_path $hash_value.dat_path" --- run the program. Please use "10_million_password_list_top_10000.txt" as the dictionary and "hash_value.dat" as the input hash value. Make sure you put a correct path.

Added MPI code. You can find them in "par_code" folder.
The projectmpi2.cpp is used to split dictionary to different parts and send them to processors.
1. use "mpiCC projectmpi2.cpp -o projectmpi2" to compile the program.
2. use projectmpi.bash to run the program.

Please load the following module:
1. gnu-4.4-compilers 
2. fftw-3.3.3
3. platfor-mpi
4. cuda-7.0
5. oracle_java-1.7u40
