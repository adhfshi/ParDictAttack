The "hash_gen.cpp" file is used to generate hash values from plain text and store the data into hash_value.dat file. This is simluating that the database and OS in real world store user passwords. For now, we only calcualte and save 1 round hash value using SHA256 algo. We will update to 10000 rounds hash values laster. Please see our "update" file for more information.

Compile "hash_gen.cpp" file by using command "g++ -o hash_gen hash_gen.cpp". If you want to generate hashs for different plain text, please modify the "hash_gen.cpp" directly.

The "cracker.cpp" file is used to dictionary attack. We use "clock()" function to time the program. Compile the code using command "g++ -o cracker cracker.cpp"

Using command "./cracker $dictionary_path $hash_value.dat_path" to crack the password hash that saved inside the .dat file.
